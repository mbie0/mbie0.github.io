My name is Miguel and I'm an Offensive Security Team Lead.
I'm a big fan of making Red Teaming and Penetration Testing fundamental components of an organization's cybersecurity program. I love cyber threat 
intelligence and malware reverse-engineering. Experienced in digital forensics and incident response in organizations of all shapes and sizes.
